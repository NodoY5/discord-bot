### Contributing to the Bot
To add commands to the bot:

1. Create your command in a .js file in the directory `/nifty` as a [module](https://www.sitepoint.com/understanding-module-exports-exports-node-js/).
2. In bot.js, require the .js file with an appropriate variable name.
3. Add to the `commands` object as shown in the example object.

Each Command will have 3 properties: `process`, `usage` and `description`.

#### Process
Each command includes a `process` property, which contains the function executed by the command. This should take two parameters - the `message` object, and `argument`, which is any text trailing the command. 

##### Some Terminology
For commands, it can be useful to have multiple functions in your module stored under the same `process` (such as how `!twitter tweet`, `!twitter search`, and `!twitter trending` are all handled by one command object). 

In general, commands can be designed like this:`!command method parameters`

Methods are the sub-commands that call different functions in your module, and should be one word long. They can be pulled from the argument parameter fed to the `process` property with `getMethod(argument)`.

Parameters are any additional text that you want to feed to your methods. They can be of any length, and can be pulled from the argument parameter fed to the `process` property with `getParameter(argument)`.

#### Usage
Next is the `usage` property. This should be a string listing all possible arguments in your command. 

__If your command does not require any additional arguments, do not create a usage property__.

#### Description
And finally, a `description` property which is just a plaintext explaination of what the command does. 

Be sure to describe what every possible instance of `usage` does in order of appearance, and keep it brief.
